#  GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity
  Data Analyst- GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity 
Project Overview:
  This project aims to analyze land temperatures by city on a global level. The main goals of the project are:

-Examining average temperature trends in different cities globally.
-To highlight the temperature differences between cities. -To understand how temperature data changes over time.
   Data Source:
Our data source is a dataset containing global land temperature data. This dataset contains the following information:

-Data Source: Global land temperature data was obtained from various weather stations and sources.

-Dataset Description: The dataset contains a table of different cities, dates, and temperature values. This data covers a long period of time.

-Data Cleaning: Data cleaning processes are performed to address missing or inconsistent data and make the data suitable for analysis.

  Tools:
 The following tools and technologies were used in this project:

-Programming Language: Python was used for data analysis and visualization.

-Data Analysis Tools: Python libraries such as pandas and numpy were used for data manipulation and analysis.

-Data Visualization Tools: Tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn were preferred for visualizing the data.

-Data Storage: Data was stored and processed in CSV files.

  Analysis Results:
Results of this project may include:

Temperature maps showing which regions are warmer or colder globally.
Time series graphs showing temperature trends in different cities.
Detailed analyzes examining temperature changes in a specific city or region.
The project provides important data for understanding global temperature changes and regional temperature variations. These data can provide valuable information in many fields, such as climate change studies, energy planning and agriculture.
